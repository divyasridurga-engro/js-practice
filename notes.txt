1. write a sudo code before actually start writing the code.
sudo code- sample code or the steps that are needed to solve the problem
2. divide and conquer - split the task into multiple sub tasks;

*** 
 >> 'console.table'- returns the json in the table format
 >> 'console.warn'- logs the warnings 
 >> 'console.error'- logs the errors

DOM- Document Object Model is an hierarchial representation of an HTML document
when we can use JS to manipulate and perform certain functionality.
- to make a website interactive we use JS to manipulate DOM.
What we see in a code is elements like-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<div class="Btn" id="btn">hello</div>
<span>welcome</span>
<h1><i>JS</i></h1>
<script>
let input=document.getElementById("#btn");
console.log(input)

DOM VIEW
DOCTYPE: html
HTML
HEAD
BODY
DIV class="Btn" id="btn"
#text: hello
#text:
SPAN
#text: welcome
#text:
H1
I
#text: JS
#text:
SCRIPT
#text: let input=document.getElementById("#btn"); console.log(input)
#text:

It is a tree structure where js can understand and perform certain functionality.
branches in the DOM are called nodes
there are different types of nodes
1. element nodes- <div> =>> tags are generally called as element nodes
2.attribute nodes- <div id="btn"></div> =>> id="btn" is a attribute node
3. text node- <div>hello</div> =>> "hello" is a text node

----------------------------------------
* How JS is executed in the browser
every browser has its own engine 
google- v8
safari- JavascriptCore
edge- chakra

js engine has two elements

- call stack :
    - it contains execution context in which code is executed
- heap:
    - it is an unstructured memory pool which stores all the object that application needs

compilation VS interpretation
----------------------------------------

array destructuring:
 - unpacking values from array and storing them as variables

 ex-1 : basic destructuring 
 let arr=[1,2,3,4]
 // i want to extract all the values in the array
 let [one,two, three, four]=arr; // [one,two, three, four]=[1,2,3,4]


 /**/ interchange the values in the array
 let array=[1,2,3,4];
 let [one, two, three, four]= array;
 // console.log(one, two, three, four)
 [four, three, two, one]=[one, two, three, four]
-------variables------- = -------values-------
 console.log(one, two, three, four)

 /**/ skipping the values in the array

 let arr=[1,2,3,4];
 let [one, , three, four]= arr;
 // we skipped 2 here by giving empty 

 /**/ destructuring nested arrays
 
 let arr=[1, 2, [3, 4,5]];
 let [a, b, [c, d, e]]=arr;
 output- a=1, b=2, c=3,d=4, e=5;

 /**/ what if there is an extra element
 we can assign the default value initially

 let [a=0, b=0, c=0, d=0]=[1,2,3];
console.log(a,b,c,d)
VM494:2 1 2 3 0

let [a=0, b=0, c=0, d=0]=[1,3];
console.log(a,b,c,d)
VM502:2 1 3 0 0

/**/ giving alias name to the destructuring part

let [i:one=0,j:two=0,k:three=0,l:four=0]= [1,2,3,4]

// in the above case we have given the alias name for the variables i, j,k,l with one, two, three, four
and also we have assigned default values as 0 so that it wont break when there are no sufficient values
